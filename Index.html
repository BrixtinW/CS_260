      <h1>Welcome to Odd One Out</h1>
      <p>Odd One Out is a game of deception, strategy and espionage. Will you have what it takes to survive being the Odd One Out?</p>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>The game begins when everyone receives the same "secret word" except the Odd-One-Out who receives a similar but slightly different word. Starting with a random player determined by the application, each player takes turns clockwise, describing their "secret word" with another word while trying to avoid giving away their identity as the potential Odd-One-Out. The other players must use their detective skills to figure out who has a different word and vote on who they think the Odd-One-Out is. If they vote the Odd-One-Out, the Odd-One-Out has one chance to guess what everyone else's word is. If the Odd-One-Out guesses the word correctly or if they are never voted out, they win. If not, everyone else wins. </p>

      <h2>Submit Secret Word Pairs</h2>
      <p>You have the chance to submite your own secret word pairs and help the Odd-One-Out community! Simply enter your word pair in the boxes below.</p>
