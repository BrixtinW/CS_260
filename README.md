<!-- 
The game is called odd one out or something
everyone gets a word and one person gets a slightly different word (the odd one out). starting with one random player, everyone says a word that indirectly points to their shared word. after everyone says one word to show they have the same word, they guess on one person to eliminate who they think is the odd one out. if they guess correctly, the odd one out has one chance to guess the correct word. If they guess correctly, they win. if they guess incorrectly everyone else wins. if they guess someone who isnt the odd one out, then that last person is eliminated from the game. the odd one out does not know that they are the odd one out.
